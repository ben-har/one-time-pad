<h2> okay so the way a OTP works is to use random numbers or characters because it makes it only deceptible to people with a key. aslo takes each individual letter and encrypting it, it uses numbers to encrpt the message we use A.S.C.I.I(american standerd code for information interchange) and then those numbers get turned into binary, we need as many charticters as our text has letters. for each letter in our orginal text we can go through and do XOR this will make a third number which then can be turned into a number through A.S.C.I.I this will resualt in the cipher text </h2>
<h2> to decrypt</h2>
<h2> first convert each letter into a number again, then we go one by one and convert each number into a binary number in order to XOR it. XOR just means when you line op to binary numbers and go colume by colume and when every a colume has a 1 and 0 put a 1 otherwise put a zero the resualting binary number will be the plain text.
