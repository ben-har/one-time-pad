<h2> okay so the way a OTP works is to use true random numbers or characters becausely making it only decrptible to people with the key</h2>
<h2> the steps of encrytion </h2>
<h2>first get your plaintext and covert it to binary</h2>
<h2>second generate a key that is totally random and, in binary, is at least as long as the plain text </h2>
<h2>produce the ciphertext by applying bitwise XOR on the plaintext and key</h2>
