<h2>okay so the way a OTP works is to use random numbers or characters because it makes it only deceptible to people with a key. The OTP also takes each individual letter and encrypts it, it uses numbers to encrypt the message we use A.S.C.I.I(american standard code for information interchange) and then those numbers get turned into binary, we need as many characters as our text has letters to encrypt it. for each letter in our original text we can go through and do XOR this will make a third number which then can be turned into a number through A.S.C.I.I this will result in the ciphertext</h2>
<h2>to decrypt</h2>
<h2>first convert each letter into a number again, then we go one by one and convert each number into a binary number in order to XOR it. XOR just means when you line up binary numbers and go column by column and when every column has a 1 and 0 put a 1 otherwise put a zero the resulting binary number will be the plain text, and then most importanly destroy the key.</h2>
