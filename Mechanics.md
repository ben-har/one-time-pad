<h2> the steps of encryption. </h2>
<h2>first get your plaintext and convert it to binary</h2>
<h2>second generate a key that is totally random and, in binary, is at least as long as the plain text </h2>
<h2>produce the ciphertext by applying bitwise XOR on the plaintext and key</h2>
<h2> to decrypt its the same process because the operation is bi-directional, it does the same process as it encrypts</h2>
